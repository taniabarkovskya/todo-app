# React Todo App with API
## Project Overview
This project is a React-based Todo application integrated with an API, designed to manage todos efficiently. Users can load todos on page load, add new todos, delete them, toggle their completion status, and rename them. The app communicates with a backend API to perform actions like adding, deleting, and updating todos, ensuring data persistence and smooth user interaction. It also includes error handling and notifications to improve the user experience during API interactions.

#### Status Toggling:
Allows users to toggle the completion status of individual todos and even update the status of all todos at once.
#### Rename Todo:
Enables users to edit todo titles directly within the app, with changes saved via API.
#### Error Handling:
Displays error notifications in case of issues with adding, deleting, or updating todos.
#### Smooth User Experience:
Uses loaders while fetching or sending data to the API, and optimizes the UI by disabling elements while actions are in progress.
